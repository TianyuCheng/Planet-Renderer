Planet Renderer
===============

This is a project targeting at making a GPU-based planet renderer.

Motivation
----------

I know a lot of people have already done a lot of work in similar projects, but I just want to give it a try and make my own planet.
With a planet, one can do a wide range of simulation, such as evolution, or even more ambitiously, a solar system, etc. It will be a lot of fun.
