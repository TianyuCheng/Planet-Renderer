\section{Introduction}

In this project, inspired by games like Minecraft, we are going to simulate
the planet, its weather, as well as atmosphere.

\section{Proposed functions}

In this project we are planning to achieve these functions as the minimal
feature set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Terrain, including height map and level of details (LOD). This allows us
to have a basic view about this planet.
\item Biomes. We may have different textures on different areas of terrain.
\item Ocean. This forms water on the planet which is the simplest one to draw.
\item Sky. Blue sky makes us felling we are on a planet with atmosphere.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Candidate functions}
We may have the following features to implement if time permits.
\begin{enumerate}
\item River. We may simulate river as well as its bed. We may also implement
waterfall at the end.
\item Sun. And night.
\item Cloud.
\item Grass and Tree.
\item Atmosphere and the solar system.
\item Weather.
\item Geographical realistic simulation. We should decide the biomes according
to the geographical knowledge.
\end{enumerate}
